\arguments{
\item{x}{Fossil occurrence data grouped into
spatiotemporally distinct assemblages}

\item{y}{A stratigraphic range dataset from which
consensus assemblage ages will be derived}

\item{assemblage}{The column name of the assemblage
groups in x}

\item{srt}{The column name of stratigraphic bases for
each element in both x and y - i.e. x and y must have
this same name for that column}

\item{end}{The column name of stratigraphic tops for
each element in both x and y - i.e. x and y must have
this same name for that column}

\item{err}{The column name flagging age errors for
occurrences in x. Age errors can be derived using}

\item{taxon}{The column name denoting the taxon names
in both x and y - i.e. x and y must have
this same name for that column}

\item{prop}{A numeric, between 0 and 1, denoting the
threshold percentage of taxa in the assemblage for
which a consensus age must be found}

\item{verbose}{A logical determining if the progress
of the redating procedure should be reported}
}
\value{
A list of two dataframes, the first recording
the results of the consensus redating procedure for
each assemblage in x, the second recording any flags
(if any) for each occurrence in x

\description{
Function to generate a consensus age for assemblages
of fossil data in x, given a table of taxonomic
ranges. The need for error-checking is informed by
the error codes for the individual fossil
occurrences within each collection - if there is no
error, then the consensus age is unchanged. If
errors are present, then a consensus age for a
threshold proportion of taxa is searched for using
the overlap of the ranges for those taxa, as given
in range table y. Taxa whose occurrences lie outside
this consensus age are flagged as potential taxonomic
errors. If the threshold consensus partially overlaps
with the assemblage age, this overlap is returned to
present overzealous alteration of the age - otherwise
the complete consensus age is returned. If a
consensus age cannot be found, the original assemblage
age is returned, and each occurrence in the collection
flagged as potential taxonomic errors.

flag_ranges. Otherwise, this can be
fudged by adding an error column to x which will
result in each collection being assessed:
\verb{x$err <- rep("0R0, times = nrow(x))}
}
