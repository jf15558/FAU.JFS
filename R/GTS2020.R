#' Lookup table of chronostratigraphic interval names
#' used in the PBDB, the interval type (e.g. ICS
#' stage, NALMA, ammonoid zone), the geographic extent
#' of the zone (global in the case of ICS intervals,
#' regional for other timescales), the base and top
#' ages (FAD and LAD) of each interval in millions of
#' years ago. These absolute ages are based primarily
#' on A Geologic Timescale 2020 by Gradstein et al.
#' All ICS intervals have GTS age boundaries. Other
#' timescales have GTS age boundaries either stated
#' directly in GTS2020, a boundary taken through
#' correlation with the base or top of an ICS interval
#' with GTS dates or measured on the correlation charts
#' in GTS2020. For a minority of intervals, other
#' literature is used to help map an interval to a
#' chronostratigraphic unit named in GTS 2020. In the
#' case of Land Mammal Ages, GTS2020 directs the user
#' to GTS2012, so those dates are retained
