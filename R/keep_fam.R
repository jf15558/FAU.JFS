#' keep_fam
#'
#' A very small helper dataset recording some specific edits
#' to the PBDB. Edits are the result of a visual inspection
#' of potential spelling errors flagged by spell_check. They
#' are recorded here so that they can be consistently
#' reapplied to the PBDB, rather than running the function
#' and using indices to make the edits, as indices are prone
#' to change with addition of new data to the PBDB
